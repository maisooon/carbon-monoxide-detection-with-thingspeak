# carbon-monoxide-detection-with-thingspeak
this project is designed to implement an IoT system for Carbon Monoxide detection including the microcontroller NodeMCU 8266 a red LED, a buzzer, and a sensor (MQ-7). then send sensor readings to ThingSpeak in order to visualize charts and plot data. If the sensor reading exceeds a predefined threshold, the buzzer will beep, the LED will glow, and an email will be sent using IFTTT.
